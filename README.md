# CellHet
A Comprehensive Tool for Cell Heterogeneity Analysis in Single-Cell Data
The CellHet package provides a comprehensive suite of tools for analyzing and visualizing cell heterogeneity in single-cell RNA-seq data across multiple comparisons. It is designed to help researchers understand how different cell types respond to various conditions, quantify the degree of heterogeneity in these responses, and identify shared and unique molecular signatures.
